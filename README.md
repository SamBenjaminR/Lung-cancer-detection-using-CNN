## Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection of lung cancer significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to detect lung cancer from medical imaging data.

## Features

- **Automatic detection**: The model can automatically detect cancerous regions in lung images.
- **Preprocessing pipeline**: Includes preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- **Customizable CNN architecture**: You can modify the layers and parameters of the CNN to suit your dataset.
- **High accuracy**: The system aims to achieve a high accuracy (0.9 or above) in lung cancer detection.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2018b or later)
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Pre-trained CNN models (optional, e.g., AlexNet, VGG)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-detection-cnn.git
    cd lung-cancer-detection-cnn
    ```

2. Install the required MATLAB toolboxes:
    - Deep Learning Toolbox
    - Image Processing Toolbox

3. (Optional) If you are using a pre-trained model, download it and add it to your MATLAB path.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is organized into `train`, `test`, and `validation` sets.
   
2. **Run Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images by running the `preprocessing.m` script:
   ```matlab
   preprocessing.m

test_model.m
Dataset
You can use public datasets like:

LUNA16: A large collection of lung CT scans for nodule detection.
Kaggle's Data Science Bowl: Lung cancer detection dataset.
Ensure that the images are preprocessed (e.g., resized, normalized) before feeding them into the CNN.

Model Architecture
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

Input Layer (Image size: 224x224x3)
Convolutional Layer
ReLU Activation
Max Pooling
Fully Connected Layer
Softmax Layer
Output Layer (Cancerous/Non-cancerous)
You can modify this architecture by editing the create_cnn.m script.

Training
The model is trained using the following settings:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 50
You can change these parameters in the train_model.m script.

Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results are visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Results
We aim to achieve an accuracy of 90% or higher. Example results include:

Accuracy: 0.92
Precision: 0.89
Recall: 0.91
